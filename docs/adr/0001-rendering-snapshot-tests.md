## Context

The rendering pipeline is mid-refactor. A `game_render` abstraction has landed
on `feat/game-render`, and a GPU backend is planned to follow. There is no
automated way to detect whether a change to a rasterizer, a palette path, or
replay-driven game logic has altered the pixels the game produces. Reviewers can
read code but cannot mechanically tell that a refactor preserves visual output.

We want a regression net that:

- Runs locally on a developer's machine in a single command.
- Compares actual rendered output against a known-good baseline on every change.
- Surfaces differences as reviewable artifacts (binary PNG diffs in pull
  requests).
- Can be updated deliberately when a pixel change is intentional.
- Works on `master`, on `feat/game-render`, and on any future GPU backend whose
  contract is "produce the same pixels".

## Decision

### Compare via git itself, not a custom byte-comparator

The harness writes the captured PNGs straight into the checked-in baseline
directory (`tests/snapshots/baselines/`) and then runs
`git diff --exit-code -- tests/snapshots/baselines/`. Any pixel change manifests
as a tracked-file modification, which the build step turns into a non-zero exit.
The PR diff that lands in code review *is* the comparison artifact — GitHub
renders binary PNGs as side-by-side image diffs that the reviewer can swipe,
onion-skin, or 2-up.

Rejected alternatives:

- A custom in-tree byte-comparator and red-where-different diff PNG was the
  original design (see git history of this ADR). It worked but duplicated
  machinery git already provides, and the resulting red-dot diff PNG was a
  programmatic localisation artifact rather than a review-grade visual diff.
  GitHub's image diff is what reviewers actually use.
- Tolerance-based RGB comparison would mask single-index off-by-one rasterizer
  regressions that round-trip to the same on-screen RGB. The signal we want is
  exactly "did the indexed framebuffer change", which byte-equality of the
  indexed PNG already gives us.

### Indexed PNG with PLTE chunk as the storage format

Baselines are stored as 8-bit indexed PNGs with the active 256-entry palette in
the PLTE chunk. The PNG's pixel buffer is the indexed framebuffer one-to-one
(one byte per pixel = one palette index), and viewers render it correctly
without us re-baking colours.

Rejected alternatives:

- Raw `.bin` framebuffers would be byte-exact but unreviewable in PRs.
- RGB PNGs require the writer to expand the palette and the comparer to contract
  it back, opening an opportunity for the colour transform itself to be wrong.
  The library `stb_image_write` is RGB-only, which is what pushed us to use a
  palette-aware encoder (initially vendored lodepng, later migrated to
  `SDL_image`'s `IMG_SavePNG` since the project already links `SDL3_image`).

### Baseline storage uses Git LFS, scoped to `tests/snapshots/baselines/*.png`

The baselines live in Git LFS via a scoped `.gitattributes` rule. Rationale: the
new "harness overwrites baselines + git diff drives review" workflow makes
baselines a routinely-updated review substrate, not a write-once asset. Each
blessed pixel change adds a full PNG revision to history (PNGs already use
deflate, so git's pack delta gains very little). LFS keeps the regular pack
store flat regardless of churn, lets shallow clones stay small, and adds zero
friction to PR review (GitHub renders LFS-backed PNGs in image diffs identically
to plain ones).

Scope is deliberately narrow — only the snapshot baselines are LFS-tracked, not
the project's icons or screenshots in `images/`.

### Single-host pixel pinning for the first iteration

Baselines are pinned to whichever single host architecture the implementing
developer is using when the baseline lands (Apple Silicon macOS at first
authoring). Floating-point drift between architectures is acknowledged and
explicitly out of scope for this iteration.

Rationale: the harness's primary value is catching same-host regressions during
a refactor. Cross-platform pixel-exact parity is a separate problem (involves
audit of every floating-point callsite that affects rendered output) with its
own ADR later.

### Update mechanism is "run, review the diff, commit"

To bless an intentional pixel change the developer just runs
`zig build test-snapshots`, sees the build fail, reviews the resulting
working-tree diff, and commits the modified baseline PNGs alongside the code
change. The commit *is* the explicit blessing gesture.

### Non-canonical hosts use scratch capture

`zig build test-snapshots -Dscratch` routes the captures into
`zig-out/snapshot-scratch/` and skips the git-diff check entirely. This lets a
developer on a non-canonical host (Linux x86_64, Windows, etc.) exercise the
capture path and inspect their pixels without ever touching the LFS-tracked
baselines, so the working tree stays clean and the PR remains scoped to whatever
code change motivated the run.

Comparing scratch against the canonical baselines is left to whatever tool the
developer prefers (e.g.
`diff -rq tests/snapshots/baselines zig-out/snapshot-scratch`, or any image-diff
viewer) — the harness intentionally doesn't enshrine a cross-platform compare
path until the cross-platform parity ADR exists.

### Hand-picked frames per replay, not every frame

Baselines are taken at hand-picked tick numbers per replay (3-4 per replay).
Adjacent ticks rarely add information; spread frames are more useful for
localising regressions and keep the baseline directory small (~1.5 MB total at
this scale, before LFS deduplication).

The current per-replay frame lists live in `build.zig`'s `snapshot_replays`
table. Each replay covers ~4 frames spanning meaningful scene differences;
intro3 is short (~200 frames) and gets four densely-spaced ticks instead.

## Consequences

- Every PR touching the rendering pipeline picks up the gate automatically.
- Intentional pixel changes require a `git add` + `git commit` step on the
  modified baselines, and the PR diff visualises them for the reviewer.
- Cross-platform CI is deferred. The harness will run locally and on a
  pinned-host CI runner; running the harness on a divergent host without
  re-pinning baselines will produce false positives.
- Long-running replay frames may exhibit non-determinism that is not caught by
  `srand(0)` alone. The current baseline frame list deliberately excludes intro7
  frame 900 because it produces non-reproducible pixels across runs; this points
  at an unseeded RNG consumer or wallclock reachable in the deep replay path. To
  be tracked as a follow-up; the harness still gates the pipeline on the 27
  stable frames in the meantime.
- Contributors and CI runners need `git lfs` installed (one-time
  `git lfs install`). Cloning without LFS still gets the source tree but not the
  actual PNG bytes, which would fail `zig build test-snapshots` loudly.

## Implementation pointers

- Capture path: `--snapshot REPLAY --frames N[,M,...] --out DIR` flag on the
  existing `roller` binary. See `PROJECTS/ROLLER/snapshot.{c,h}` and
  `PROJECTS/ROLLER/png_writer.{c,h}`.
- Build step: `zig build test-snapshots`. Drives the snapshot binary serially
  across each entry in `snapshot_replays`, writing PNGs straight into
  `tests/snapshots/baselines/`, then runs
  `git diff --exit-code --stat -- tests/snapshots/baselines/`. With `-Dscratch`
  the captures land in `zig-out/snapshot-scratch/` and the diff check is
  skipped.
- LFS scope: `.gitattributes` carries
  `tests/snapshots/baselines/*.png filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text`.
